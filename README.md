## Description and Instructions - Cara Chang

The purpose of my project is to bring a crossover between the photo booth installed within a Mac system and the Snapchat app all into one interface that users can interact with. 

To use the interface, the user can customize and play around with a selection of icon images that will be placed on the user's keypoints on their face. There are buttons on the side of the canvas that tells the user which option they are selecting, Besides the icon images, there is also a slider bar that the user can use to change the thickness of the lines connecting the keypoints along the body. Sliding the slider bar from left to right will increase the thickness of the lines. After the user has chosen a desirable icon image and the thickness of the line to their liking, the user has a button that they can click on that will take a photo of the canvas in that moment. The photo will then go to the user's downloads in their laptop device, which they can click on to see the captured image. 

## Screenshot of working interface

I was not sure how to attach a screenshot of the working interface so I attached the screenshot into the p5pose folder.
